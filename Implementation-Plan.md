# Roleplay Platform Implementation Plan

## Project Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for a character-based roleplay platform similar to F-List, featuring character creation, profile management, kinks system, and chat functionality.

## Technology Stack Comparison

### Option 1: Django Backend with Next.js Frontend
**Benefits:**
- Django's robust ORM for complex database relationships
- PostgreSQL for efficient data storage and querying
- Next.js for a responsive, modern frontend experience
- Separate backend/frontend allows for specialized optimization

**Challenges:**
- More complex deployment setup
- Requires API development between services

### Option 2: Next.js Full-Stack Application
**Benefits:**
- Simplified development workflow
- Server components for efficient rendering
- Easier deployment with platforms like Vercel/Netlify
- Modern React patterns for responsive UI

**Challenges:**
- Less mature ORM compared to Django
- May require more custom work for complex queries

## Core Features and Components

### 1. User Authentication System
- Registration, login, email verification
- Profile management
- User preferences and settings

### 2. Character Management System
- Character creation with detailed information fields
- BBC/CSS toggle for character descriptions
- Image management for character profiles
- Kinks/preferences system with ratings

### 3. Kinks System
- Predefined kinks organized by categories
- Four rating options (Fave, Yes, Maybe, No)
- Custom kinks support
- Display configuration on character profiles

### 4. Character Profile Display
- Sidebar with basic character information
- Tabbed main content area
- BBC/CSS formatted character descriptions
- Organized kinks display

### 5. Chat System
- Private and group chat functionality
- Character switching within chats
- Real-time messaging with WebSockets
- Chat history and search

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation
- Setup project architecture
- Implement user authentication
- Create basic database models
- Establish UI framework and design system

### Phase 2: Character Management
- Build character creation forms
- Implement BBC/CSS description editor
- Create character image upload system
- Develop character profile display

### Phase 3: Kinks System
- Implement kinks database structure
- Create kinks management interface
- Develop rating system
- Build profile display for kinks

### Phase 4: Chat Foundation
- Implement basic chat functionality
- Add character selection in chats
- Create real-time messaging
- Develop chat history and search

### Phase 5: Refinement
- Performance optimization
- Security enhancements
- UI/UX improvements
- Testing and bug fixes

## Technical Architecture

### Database Schema
```
# Core models
- User
- Character
- InfoCategory
- InfoField
- KinkCategory
- Kink
- CharacterKink
- CustomKink
- CharacterImage
- ChatRoom
- CustomIcon
```

### API Endpoints (if using separate backend/frontend)
- /api/auth/ - Authentication endpoints
- /api/users/ - User management
- /api/characters/ - Character CRUD operations
- /api/kinks/ - Kinks management
- /api/chat/ - Chat functionality

## BBC/CSS Editor Implementation
- Toggle between editing modes
- Preview functionality
- Syntax highlighting
- Common formatting tools
- Media embedding support

## Recommended Next Steps
1. Decide on technology stack (Django + Next.js or pure Next.js)
2. Set up project structure and configuration
3. Implement user authentication system
4. Begin character model development
5. Create basic UI components for character profiles
